# RFID_Implementation_Program
This GitHub repository contains Arduino code designed for managing RFID systems
This GitHub repository contains Arduino code designed for managing RFID systems. With this code, users can set the RFID frequency and adjust the transmission power. Additionally, the code allows users to retrieve detailed information about the RFID reader. It also facilitates the detection of RFID tags and the extraction of their Electronic Product Code (EPC). This repository provides a comprehensive solution for customizing and optimizing RFID operations using Arduino.
