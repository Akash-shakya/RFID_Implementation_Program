This GitHub repository contains Arduino code designed for managing RFID systems
This GitHub repository contains Arduino code designed for managing RFID systems. With this code, users can set the RFID frequency and adjust the transmission power. Additionally, the code allows users to retrieve detailed information about the RFID reader. It also facilitates the detection of RFID tags and the extraction of their Electronic Product Code (EPC). This repository provides a comprehensive solution for customizing and optimizing RFID operations using Arduino.

<h2>Connecting the RRUHFOEM01 RFID Reader Module to Arduino</h2>h2
To use the RRUHFOEM01 RFID reader module with an Arduino, follow the connection instructions below:

VCC: Connect the VCC pin of the RFID module to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
GND: Connect the GND pin of the RFID module to the GND pin on the Arduino.
TX: Connect the TX pin of the RFID module to Digital Pin 2 on the Arduino.
RX: Connect the RX pin of the RFID module to Digital Pin 3 on the Arduino.
